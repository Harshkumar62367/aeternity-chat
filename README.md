## Problem
Navigating through numerous web links and pages to find answers about Aeternity can be tedious and often yields inconsistent results.

## What we built 👨‍💻
ÆChat is designed to assist users in comprehending the fundamentals of Aeternity and its functionalities. The bot leverages natural language processing to enable users to pose questions in a conversational manner, tailored for the Æ community. It utilizes AI algorithms to retrieve the most pertinent information from an extensive database concerning Aeternity.

## How it is solved ✨
Our solution provides a centralized platform for obtaining comprehensive information about Aeternity blockchain. AEChat, built atop the OpenAI API, delivers concise text-based responses and even provides auditory answers for enhanced accessibility.

## Future Plans

### Shortcomings:
Presently, AEChat lacks adequate prompting mechanisms and cannot address advanced queries regarding code-related topics such as Sophia programming language.

### Future Plans:
We aim to refine our model for more precise and optimized responses. Plans include extending the chat's word limit and utilizing the premium API version for expedited responses. Additionally, we intend to educate ÆChat on various projects within the Aeternity ecosystem and their impact.
